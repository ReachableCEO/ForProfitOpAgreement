# ForProfitOpAgreement

This is the operating agreement (in combination with items found in CommonBoilerplate)
used by :

Suborbital Systems Development Co LLC
RackRental Operating Company LLC
(and a basis for) Redwood 

(you can find redwood agreement in its own repo )

No warranties, express or implied. It's worked well for us, YMWV!!!

Also no build pipeline is provided. Our private repos have a build pipeline (bash script with 
cat and pandoc, nothing fancy). 

We are already giving away a very expensive document for free, figure out how to build it yourself :)

maintaining a genericized build pipeline isn't feasible with our limited time.

Pull requests welcome
